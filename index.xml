      <description>This application takes inputs related to a URL&amp;rsquo;s features and depending upon that, it predicts whether the website is malicious or not. After doing various Experimentations it was decided that XGBoost was well performing ML algorithm for this use case The inputs are preprocessed and then given to the XGBoost model Depending upon the output of the model ,Output(whether the website is malicious or not) is displayed Link to Github</description>

      <description>Data Science and its various types are of my main interests. My name is Saurabh Naik and I have been working in the data science field doing various AI solutions tasks for more than 1 year. I have held data science positions in various startups as an intern. I transitioned into data science from a software engineering background. When I was first starting out on my data science journey I was extremely lost; there were very few resources for me to learn about this field from.</description>
